This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

Put your OpenAI API key and AWS IAM credentials in a .env file in the project root directory. Your IAM user should minimally have full access to AmazonPolly.

OPENAI_KEY=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=

## Dev and Debug on Android
Just start up the app with `npm start`. It is configured to use the Amplify-deployed resources for auth and the thirdparthard API (mine) even in dev. Should figure out how to debug the backend locally.

To debug the app on Android, I turned on USB debugging, visited chrome:://inspect#devices in Chrome on my desktop and saw it the list of things I could inspect. The short USB cable and the mac adapter worked as a combo. I tried debugging over wifi but couldn't get it to work.

The SpeechRecognition API will only work over a secure connection, so I use `ngrok http 3000` for ingress to the local app. I had to sign up for a free ngrok account and follow the procedure to install my authtoken with `ngrok config add-authtoken <the token>`.

When I'd added the permission requester (getUserMedia) things started working briefly and then stop. I rebooted
my phone and that fixed it. Turns out hard-closing Chrome and restarting is probably enough.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
